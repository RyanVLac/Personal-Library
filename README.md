# Personal-Library
This project is a personal library app for managing and reading your own PDFs.

It is designed to work completely offline and stores everything locally on the device. Users can upload PDFs, organize them into folders, rename files, delete them, and generate or change thumbnails for each PDF. The app also includes a built-in PDF reader.

The backend manages files and metadata using a local database or a lightweight local HTTP server. The frontend provides the user interface for browsing, organizing, and reading PDFs. Even though it runs offline, the project is structured as a full-stack application with a separate frontend and backend.
